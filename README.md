# Heart_Expert_System
Artificial Intelligence Project on prediction of heart disease
=========================================
## About Database
- This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been    used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
